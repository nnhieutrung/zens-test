        A child asked his father, "How were people born?" So his father said, "Adam and Eve made babies, then their babies became adults and made babies, and so on."
        <br />
        The child then went to his mother, asked her the same question and she told him, "We were monkeys then we evolved to become like we are now."
        <br />
        The child ran back to his father and said, "You lied to me!" His father replied, "No, your mom was talking about her side of the family."
